# Tic-Tac-Toe with RxJS and Rimmel
Little game in a very advanced example to show RxJS, Rimmel and a bit hardcore functional programming in action.

The purpose of this demo is to show how you can write the same stuff with less code and maybe compare it to other frameworks.

*WARNING*: If you don't have a good understanding of RxJS, this won't be en easy read!

*WARNING*: This code was conceived to be short, rather than readable.

Its main elements are all observable streams (Rx Subjects), connected to each-other and ultimately to the DOM elements they control or are controlled by.

## Running
Spin up a local server to host the project folder and point a browser to it.

`python -m http.server`

http://localhost:8000/
