# Tic-Tac-Toe with RxHTML
Little showcase app to demo RxHTML + RxJS in action

It may bite if you're not familiar with RxJS.
This example has two main purposes:
	- show a real-life example of RxHTML in action
	- show how little code is enough to make it

## Running
run a local server to host the otherwise static folder, and point a browser to it

`python -m http.server`

http://localhost:8000/
